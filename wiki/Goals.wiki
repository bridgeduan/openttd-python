#summary the goals of this project

= Goals =

 * This python module should provide easy access to the openttd Game.
 * This library will be used to code a bot that has certain functions (see below)
 * This library should help to improve certain security holes and issues with the current network protocol

= Library =
Requirements:
 * platform indepenndent
 * splitting into several layers of complexity (like basic communication class and complete client) to ease the usage
 * robust: the library may not crash servers or clients in any way
 * fast: it should not create lag when running on the same host as the server
 * easy to configure: 

= Bot =
 * 3 way connection interface:
  * per spectator account (not modifying the sources)
  * per special connection to the server (not coded yet)
  * per console wrapper (like autopilot)
 * Basic Functions:
  * logging user statistics and actions into a file (partly working)
  * providing a IRCbridge in order to connect the ingame chat and the IRC chat (working)
  * webserver to view statistics (only basics done)
 * advanced Functions (nothing done of this):
  * controlling the server via rcon 
  * votes: enables users to vote for changed settings of the server and server reset
  * user authentication: only certain users are able to give the bot important commands via ingame chat or IRC


= Implementation Details =
here we will discuss the design and implementation of several components:
 * EventSystem
